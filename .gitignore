"""
.gitignore
-----------
Author: Tony Ngo

Description:
    This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore when uploading to GitHub. 
    It protects sensitive information (like API keys), large data files, and 
    temporary system files from being shared publicly.

This:
    Hides API keys and environment variables.
    Keeps large data and model files out of the repository.
    Ignores cache, system, and log files that clutter version control.
